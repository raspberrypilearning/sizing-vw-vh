When setting the size of an element using CSS, you might want the height or width to change depending on the size of the screen it is being viewed on. 

The visible area of a webpage is called the **viewport** and this will differ between devices: a phone screen is a very different size to a laptop screen, for example. 

In CSS, you can use `vh` to set the size of elements relative to the **height** of the viewport. The number you put in front of `vh` is the **percentage** of the viewport height the element should take up. So `50vh` is **half** the viewport's height. 

`vw` works the same way for the **width** of the viewport.
